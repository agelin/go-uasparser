# go-uasparser

A Go implementation of the [user-agent-string.info](http://user-agent-string.info/) (UAS.info)
User-Agent string analysis tool. See the [GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/signal/go-uasparser)
for more detailed usage.

## Disclaimer(s)

This package does its best to similarly implement the logic from the PHP implementation found on
[UAS.info](http://user-agent-string.info/download); except where the documentation states that it didn't
want to. Should you find glaring mistakes, please do open an issue or a pull request.
